# Drug-Classification-Using-User-Reviews-
This innovative project redefines medication recommendation by leveraging user-generated reviews through sentiment analysis and machine learning. Built as part of an academic pursuit at the Symbiosis Institute of Technology, the platform empowers users to make informed decisions about over-the-counter (OTC) drugs based on real-world experiences.

Key Highlights:

Data-Driven Insights: Utilized the UCI Drug Review dataset (21,000+ reviews) to analyze drug efficacy, side effects, and user satisfaction using the VADER sentiment analysis model.
Advanced Clustering Techniques: Applied K-means clustering to classify medications into "Best," "Average," and "Worst" categories based on sentiment polarity.
End-to-End Solution: Developed a user-friendly web interface for symptom input, generating ranked drug recommendations, and improving healthcare accessibility.
Transparent and Unbiased: Focused solely on user reviews, eliminating biases from paid promotions or subjective recommendations.
This project exemplifies the fusion of AI, sentiment analysis, and user-centric design to enhance consumer health outcomes. #ArtificialIntelligence #HealthcareInnovation #SentimentAnalysis
